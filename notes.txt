publications collision within same literature is possible

a date of adding literature to database can be lower than literature (book/proceedings) publishing date

you can select the 'department staff' status for publication author even if he/she is only a student (or 'other')

for database validation class 'http://example.com' and 'http://example.com/' are not equal

stupid main page layout, has to be changed
