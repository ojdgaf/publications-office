## About

Publications Office is an information system allowing you to easily manage a collection of publications written by teachers and students. You may search, download scientific works and certainly add something of your own. Each publication has authors and related literature which you can always explore more specifically. For example, there are three different kind of literature and many bibliographic databases available to choose.

Currently the project ain't finished yet, I'm trying to work on it in my spare time during university days.
